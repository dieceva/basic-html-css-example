    <p>But what are these games about?</p>

        <section><h2> Dota 2 </h2>
            <p>Dota 2 is a strategy MOBA game in which each team 
        (composing of 5 people) try to destroy the enemy's "ancient" which
        is kind of a relic inside each team's base and is guarded by 
        11 defensive towers in total.</p>
            <p>Every player can choose a Hero from a group of 120+ and 
        this is called the draft.
        Drafting is one of the most important things in the 
        game since many heroes counter others and you can combine 
        their skills to make a good strategy.
            </p>
            <aside>Out of the professional scenes of these games, Dota 2 is the one that is the biggest, with prize
                pools of millions of dollars every year.

        <h2>Clash Royale</h2>
            <p>Clash Royale is a tower defense mobile game in which the objective
        is to destroy enemy towers and defend yours. It became very popular
        because it is the twin brother game of clash of clans. Gameplay is very different
        but characters of the game are almost the same, also both games were
        developed by the company Supercell.
