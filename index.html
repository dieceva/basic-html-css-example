            <h2> <a href="C:\Users\sa_di\Documents\Tamwood\Assignment_1/dota2.html">Dota2</a></h2>
            <p>Dota 2 is a strategy MOBA game in which each team
                (composing of 5 people) try to destroy the enemy's "ancient" which
                is kind of a relic inside each team's base and is guarded by
                11 defensive towers in total.</p>
            <p>Every player can choose a Hero from a group of 120+ and
                this is called the draft.
                Drafting is one of the most important things in the
                game since many heroes counter others and you can combine
                their skills to make a good strategy.
            </p>
            <aside>Out of the professional scenes of these games, Dota 2 is the one that is the biggest, with prize
                pools of millions of dollars every year.

            <h2><a href="C:\Users\sa_di\Documents\Tamwood\Assignment_1/clash.html">Clash Royale</a></h2>
            <p>Clash Royale is a tower defense mobile game in which the objective
                is to destroy enemy towers and defend yours. It became very popular
                because it is the twin brother game of clash of clans. Gameplay is very different
                but characters of the game are almost the same, also both games were
                developed by the company Supercell.

            <h2><a href="C:\Users\sa_di\Documents\Tamwood\Assignment_1/age.html">Age of Empires IV</a></h2>
            <p>Age of Empires is an old franchise that has evolved throughout time, along with
                their recurrent users. It is a middle aged themed game in which you play
                as a certain tribe or small society and you have to complete tasks in order to
                develop yours. Eventually you'll have a millitary to attack the enemies before they
                attack you in order to conquer the others, build an empire and win,
                hence the name of the game Age of Empires.

            <h2><a href="C:\Users\sa_di\Documents\Tamwood\Assignment_1/fortnite.html">Fortnite Mods</a></h2>
            <p>Fortnite is a very famous game that needs no introduction now. It is basically a battle royale
                with add-onns such as buildings, mods, etc. I don't really play this game too much, mostly with friends
                that have consoles
                since this game is cross-platform.
