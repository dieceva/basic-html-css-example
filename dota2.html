        <p>Dota 2 is a strategy MOBA game in which each team 
    (composing of 5 people) try to destroy the enemy's "ancient" which
    is kind of a relic inside each team's base and is guarded by 
    11 defensive towers in total.</p>
    <p>Every player can choose a Hero from a group of 120+ and 
        this is called the draft.
        Drafting is one of the most important things in the 
        game since many heroes counter others and you can combine 
        their skills to make a good strategy.
